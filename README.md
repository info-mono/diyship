| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_LEFT`  | Command to print left prompt.  |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_RIGHT` | Command to print right prompt. |

> **Note** You can disable right prompt by `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_RIGHT="test"`

DIYship will export these following environment variables before running the commands to print out prompts,
so you could utilize theme informations in your script/program:

| Environment variable  | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$DIYSHIP_SHELL`      | Current shell name.                                           |
| `$DIYSHIP_STATUS`     | The status code of the previously run command.                |
| `$DIYSHIP_PIPESTATUS` | Status codes from a command pipeline.                         |
| `$DIYSHIP_DURATION`   | The execution duration of the last command (in milliseconds). |
| `$DIYSHIP_JOBS`       | The number of currently running jobs                          |
| `$DIYSHIP_KEYMAP`     | The current keymap.                                           |
