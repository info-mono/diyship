## ⚙️ Configuration

DIYship is basically execute a command (which could be a path to an **executable** script file or program) and take it output as a prompt,
you can change the command through environment variable:<br>
`export DIYSHIP_COMMAND_<POSITION>="<command>"`

| Environment variable    | Default                          | Description                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_LEFT`  | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diyship/left`  | Command to print left prompt  |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_RIGHT` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diyship/right` | Command to print right prompt |

DIYship will export these following environment variables before running the commands to print out prompts,
so you could utilize theme informations in your script/program:

| Environment variable  | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$DIYSHIP_SHELL`      | Current shell name.                                           |
| `$DIYSHIP_STATUS`     | The status code of the previously run command.                |
| `$DIYSHIP_PIPESTATUS` | Status codes from a command pipeline.                         |
| `$DIYSHIP_DURATION`   | The execution duration of the last command (in milliseconds). |
| `$DIYSHIP_JOBS`       | The number of currently running jobs                          |
| `$DIYSHIP_KEYMAP`     | The current keymap.                                           |

Do to many technical limitation, not every shell support all the features:
