- [`wc`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_(Unix)) for job counting (required by Ion).
- [`cat`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)) for return workaround (required by Xonsh).

```toml
startup = [
	"mkdir ~/.cache/diyship",
	"diyship nushell | save ~/.cache/diyship/init.nu",
	"source ~/.cache/diyship/init.nu"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

DIYship is basically execute a command (which could be a path to an **executable** script file or program) and take it output as a prompt,
you can change the command through environment variable:<br>
`export DIYSHIP_COMMAND_<POSITION>="<command>"`

| Environment variable    | Default                          | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_LEFT`  | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diyship/left`  | Command to print left prompt.  |
| `DIYSHIP_COMMAND_RIGHT` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diyship/right` | Command to print right prompt. |

DIYship will export these following environment variables before running the commands to print out prompts,
so you could utilize theme informations in your script/program:

| Environment variable  | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$DIYSHIP_SHELL`      | Current shell name.                                           |
| `$DIYSHIP_STATUS`     | The status code of the previously run command.                |
| `$DIYSHIP_PIPESTATUS` | Status codes from a command pipeline.                         |
| `$DIYSHIP_DURATION`   | The execution duration of the last command (in milliseconds). |
| `$DIYSHIP_JOBS`       | The number of currently running jobs                          |
| `$DIYSHIP_KEYMAP`     | The current keymap.                                           |

Do to many technical limitation, not every shell support all features:

| Feature              | Bash | Zsh | Fish | Powershell | Ion | Elvish | Tcsh | Nushell | Xonsh |
| -------------------- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---------- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Left prompt          | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ    |
| Right prompt         |      | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   |            |     | ‚úÖ     |      |         |       |
| Export current shell | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ    |
| Export status        | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ  |        | ‚úÖ   |         | ‚úÖ    |
| Export pipe status   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   |            |     |        |      |         |       |
| Export duration      | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ    |
| Export jobs          | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ     |      |         | ‚úÖ    |
